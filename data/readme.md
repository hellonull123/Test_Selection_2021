## ACEngine
ACEngine is a model that simulate some safety functionalities in the A/C engine

## CW
CW is a model that simulate the electrics and mechanics of four car findows

## EMB
EMB is a model for software model controller which includes a continuous PID controller and a discrete state machine

(The test data file for EMB is too large. We upload it to a google drive. Please download this data set here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NgQy5D6zjMAj3x7ItrfqpYl1IAGHv8EV/view?usp=sharing) and put it in this folder)
